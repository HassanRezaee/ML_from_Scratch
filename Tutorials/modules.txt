# Modules: A module is a file with some Python codes
# Purpose: to make the code cleaner, all the functions are saved in a separate python file and are called upon whenever needed.
###
#
# In the convertors.py file we have the following:

# def lbs_to_kg(weight):
# return weight * 0.45
# def kg_to_lbs(weight):
# return weight / 0.45
###


# import the entire module
import convertors
print(convertors.lbs_to_kg(weight=100))

# import a function from that module


from convertors import kg_to_lbs
print(kg_to_lbs(weight=100))
